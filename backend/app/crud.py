# This file is intended to contain CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the database.
# In a larger FastAPI project, you would define functions here to interact with the database models.
# For example, you might have functions like create_plant, get_plant_by_id, update_plant, delete_plant, etc.
# These functions would be imported and used by your API routers to keep business logic separate from route definitions.
#
# In this project, the CRUD logic is currently handled directly in the router file (plant_router.py),
# so this file is empty. You can use it in the future if you want to refactor or expand your backend.

# This file contains CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the Plant
# model. Each function interacts with the database using SQLAlchemy ORM.
